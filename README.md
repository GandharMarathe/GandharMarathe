## 🤔 Who am I?

I'm a curious tinkerer who loves bringing ideas to life with code, circuits, and a pinch of coffee. ☕⚡ You’ll often find me experimenting with Arduino projects, making physics do cool things, and debugging code at 3 AM (because bugs only appear when you're about to sleep, right?).

## 🔥 What I’m Cooking Up

- **Physics & Engineering**: Building things that make science look cool! Currently working on a wind-measuring anemometer using ping-pong balls, sensors, and Arduino magic. 🏗️💨
- **Code & Automation**: Turning caffeine into scripts that (hopefully) work. 🤖💻
- **Random Experiments**: If it blinks, moves, or makes noise, I’ve probably taken it apart and tried to rebuild it.

## 💡 Fun Facts

- My debugging process involves deep staring contests with the screen. 👀
- My code works 60% of the time… every time. 

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech I Like

- 🎮 **Unreal Engine / Unity** – Making virtual worlds come to life.
- 🐍 **Python, C++** – Coding my way through the chaos.
- 📝 **Markdown & Documentation** – Because future me won’t remember what past me did.
