🤔 Who am I?

I'm a curious tinkerer who loves bringing ideas to life with code, circuits, and a pinch of coffee. ☕⚡ You’ll often find me experimenting with Arduino projects, making physics do cool things, and debugging code at 3 AM (because bugs only appear when you're about to sleep, right?).

🔥 What I’m Cooking Up

Physics & Engineering: Building things that make science look cool! Currently working on a wind-measuring anemometer using ping-pong balls, sensors, and Arduino magic. 🏗️💨

Code & Automation: Turning caffeine into scripts that (hopefully) work. 🤖💻

Random Experiments: If it blinks, moves, or makes noise, I’ve probably taken it apart and tried to rebuild it.

💡 Fun Facts

My debugging process involves deep staring contests with the screen. 👀

My code works 60% of the time… every time. 

🛠️ Tools & Tech I Like
Unreal engine/unity

🐍 Python, C++ – Coding my way through the chaos.

📝 Markdown & Documentation – Because future me won’t remember what past me did.
